# LDAP and JWT Authentication in Spring Boot with Active Directory on Windows Server
Implementing LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in a Spring Boot application involves a series of steps, from project setup to deployment. This guide outlines the essential steps for a GitHub-hosted project, excluding specific code snippets.

# 1. Understanding the Requirements
- Before starting the implementation, ensure you understand the following:

  - LDAP: A protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network, such as Active Directory (AD).
  - JWT: A compact, self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- Active Directory: A directory service from Microsoft that provides a centralized authentication and directory service.
# 2. Setting Up the Development Environment
- Tools Required:
   - Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or later)
   - Spring Boot framework
   - Maven or Gradle build tool
  - Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code
  - Git for version control
- Install Dependencies:
  - Spring Security
  - Spring LDAP
  - JWT library (e.g., jjwt)
- Optional: Spring Data JPA for database operations
# 3. Configuring Active Directory
- Set up Active Directory on a Windows Server:
Install and configure the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role.
Create and organize user accounts and groups.
Set up an Organizational Unit (OU) in AD for the users you want to authenticate.
- Ensure AD Connectivity:
Verify that your Spring Boot application can connect to the AD server using LDAP.
# 5. Implementing LDAP Authentication
- Set up LDAP Configuration:
Configure LDAP properties in application.properties or application.yml.
Include details like url, base-dn, manager-dn, and password.
- Configure Spring Security:
Integrate LDAP authentication into the Spring Security filter chain.
Define the AuthenticationProvider to connect with Active Directory.
# 6. Adding JWT Authentication
- Define JWT Properties:
Set up secret keys, token expiration, and issuer details in your properties file.
- Implement JWT Token Generation:
Create a service to generate and validate JWT tokens upon successful LDAP authentication.
Secure Endpoints:
Use @PreAuthorize or @Secured annotations to restrict access based on user roles.
# 7. Testing and Debugging
- Local Testing:
Test the LDAP connection and authentication using Postman or a similar tool.
Verify JWT token issuance and validation.
- Debugging Tips:
Enable detailed logging for Spring Security and LDAP.
Use tools like ldapsearch or PowerShell to query the AD server directly.
#  8. Deployment and Integration
- Prepare the Application for Deployment:
Use Docker to containerize the application.
Include environment variables for sensitive configurations.
- Deploy on a Server:
Host the application on a cloud platform or an on-premises server.
Ensure the server can communicate with the AD server.
